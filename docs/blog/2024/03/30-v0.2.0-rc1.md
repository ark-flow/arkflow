# ArkFlow v0.2.0-rc1 is now available!

We are excited to announce the release of ArkFlow v0.2.0-rc1! ArkFlow is a high-performance Rust stream processing engine that provides powerful data stream processing capabilities. This version brings many important features and improvements.

## Key Features

### Diverse Component Support

#### Input Components
- **Kafka**: Support for consuming messages from Kafka topics
- **MQTT**: Receive data from MQTT brokers
- **HTTP**: Receive data through HTTP endpoints
- **Memory**: Read data from memory message queues

#### Output Components
- **Kafka**: Write messages to Kafka topics
- **MQTT**: Publish messages to MQTT brokers
- **HTTP**: Send messages to HTTP servers
- **Memory**: Write messages to memory queues

#### Buffer Components
- **Memory Buffer**: Provides memory message queues for temporary message storage and buffering, with backpressure support

### Powerful Processing Capabilities

#### SQL Query Support
- Built-in SQL processor using DataFusion as the query engine
- Support for rich SQL features:
  - Aggregation functions
  - Window functions
  - Subqueries
  - Scalar functions

#### Data Processing
- JSON processing
- Protobuf encoding/decoding
- Batch processing support

### Extensibility
- Modular design
- Easy to extend with new input, output, and processor components

## Quick Start

1. Create a configuration file `config.yaml`:
```yaml
input:
  type: "kafka"
  topics: ["my-topic"]
  brokers: ["localhost:9092"]

processors:
  - type: "sql"
    query: "SELECT * FROM flow WHERE value > 100"

output:
  type: "http"
  url: "http://example.com/data"
```

2. Run ArkFlow:
```bash
./arkflow -c config.yaml
```

## Next Steps

We will continue to improve and optimize ArkFlow, adding more features and component support. Community contributions and feedback are welcome!
